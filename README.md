## What Is Nidra Abundance Code?

*Nidra Abundance Code* is a digital manifestation program created by neuroscientist **Michael Shaw**. It‚Äôs designed to help you manifest abundance‚Äîespecially financial‚Äîby guiding you into a deeply relaxed brain state while you sleep.

The system is rooted in **Yoga Nidra**, a sleep-based meditation practice, and enhanced with **binaural frequencies**, **sound layering**, and **abundance affirmations**. The goal is to reach your subconscious mind directly when it‚Äôs most open to suggestion.

## How Does It Work?

The process is straightforward, but the science behind it is powerful:

### 1. Relaxation Through Yoga Nidra
The session starts with a guided relaxation that mimics the ancient practice of Yoga Nidra, helping you wind down and enter a trance-like state.

### 2. Brainwave Synchronization
Through embedded **Theta and Delta brainwave frequencies**, your brain is slowly guided into a state where subconscious reprogramming is most effective.

### 3. Subconscious Reprogramming
Embedded affirmations focused on wealth, clarity, and worthiness are fed directly to your subconscious, without any conscious resistance.

### 4. Daily Repetition
Consistent use (preferably nightly) reinforces new neural patterns and mindset shifts over time.
